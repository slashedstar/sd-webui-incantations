# Extension Features

---
## Smoothed Energy Guidance
Increases quality of outputs by blurring the self-attention in the middle block layers, with minimal added inference time.
Recommended to fix the CFG scale to 3.0, and control the effect using the Blur Sigma value. Increase CFG if the effect is insufficient.

#### Controls
* **SEG Blur Sigma** - Controls the sigma value (2^sigma) in the Gaussian Blur. Values greater than 10.5 is "infinite blur".
* **Start Step**: Start SEG on this step.
* **End Step**: End SEG after this step.

#### Results
SD XL

* Unconditional

## Semantic CFG (S-CFG)
https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05384  
Dynamically rescale CFG guidance per semantic region to a uniform level to improve image / text alignment.  
**Very computationally expensive**: A batch size of 4 with 1024x1024 will max out a 24GB 4090.

#### Controls
* **SCFG Scale**: Multiplies the correction by a constant factor. Default: 1.0.
* **SCFG R**: A hyperparameter controlling the factor of cross-attention map refinement. Higher values use more memory and computation time. Default: 4.
* **Rate Min**: The minimum rate that the CFG can be scaled by. Default: 0.8.
* **Rate Max**: The maximum rate that the CFG can be scaled by. Default: 3.0.
* **Clamp Rate**: Overrides Rate Max. Clamps the Max Rate to Clamp Rate / CFG. Default: 0.0.
* **Start Step**: Start S-CFG on this step.
* **End Step**: End S-CFG after this step.

#### Results
Prompt: "A cute puppy on the moon", Min Rate: 0.5, Max Rate: 10.0
- SD 1.5

## Perturbed Attention Guidance
https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17377  
An alternative/complementary method to CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) that increases sampling quality.

# Update: 20-05-2024
Implemented a new feature called "Saliency-Adaptive Noise Fusion" derived from ["High-fidelity Person-centric Subject-to-Image Synthesis"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10329).  

This feature combines the guidance from PAG and CFG in an adaptive way that improves image quality especially at higher guidance scales.  

Check out the paper authors' project repository here: https://github.com/CodeGoat24/Face-diffuser  

#### Controls
* **Use Saliency-Adaptive Noise Fusion**: Use improved method of combining CFG + PAG.
* **PAG Scale**: Controls the intensity of effect of PAG on the generated image.  
* **PAG Start Step**: Step to start using PAG.
* **PAG End Step**: Step to stop using PAG. 

#### Results
Prompt: "a puppy and a kitten on the moon"
- SD 1.5

## CFG Interval / CFG Scheduler
https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07724 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13040 

Constrains the usage of CFG to within a specified noise interval. Allows usage of high CFG levels (>15) without drastic alteration of composition.  

Adds controllable CFG schedules. For Clamp-Linear, use (c=2.0) for SD1.5 and (c=4.0) for SDXL. For PCS, use (s=1.0) for SD1.5 and (s=0.1) for SDXL.  

To use CFG Scheduler, PAG Active must be set True! PAG scale can be set to 0.

#### Controls
* **Enable CFG Scheduler**: Enables the CFG Scheduler.
* **CFG Schedule Type**: Sets the schedule type to apply CFG.
    - Constant: The default CFG method (constant value over all timesteps)
    - Interval: Constant with CFG only being applied within the specified noise interval!
    - Clamp-Linear: Clamps the CFG to the maximum of (c, Linear)
    - Clamp-Cosine: Clamps the CFG to the maximum of (c, Cosine)
    - PCS: Powered Cosine, lower values are typically better
* **CFG Noise Interval Start**: Minimum noise level to use CFG with. SDXL recommended value: 0.28.
* **CFG Noise Interval End**: Maximum noise level to use CFG with. SDXL recommended value: >5.42.


#### Results
##### CFG Interval
Prompt: "A pointillist painting of a raccoon looking at the sea."
- SD XL

##### CFG Schedule
Prompt: "An epic lithograph of a handsome salaryman carefully pouring coffee from a cup into an overflowing carafe, 4K, directed by Wong Kar Wai"

## Multi-Concept T2I-Zero / Attention Regulation

#### Update: 29-04-2024
The algorithms previously implemented for T2I-Zero were incorrect. They should be working much more stably now. See the previous result in the 'images' folder for an informal comparison between old and new.

Implements Corrections by Similarities and Cross-Token Non-Maximum Suppression from https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07419

Also implements some methods from "Enhancing Semantic Fidelity in Text-to-Image Synthesis: Attention Regulation in Diffusion Models" https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06381

#### Corrections by Similarities
Reduces the contribution of tokens on far away or conceptually unrelated tokens.

#### Cross-Token Non-Maximum Suppression
Attempts to reduces the mixing of features of unrelated concepts.

#### Controls:
* **Step End**: After this step, the effect of both CbS and CTNMS ends.
* **Correction by Similarities Window Size**: The number of adjacent tokens on both sides that can influence each token
* **CbS Score Threshold**: Tokens with similarity below this threshold have their effect reduced
* **CbS Correction Strength**: How much the Correction by Similarities effects the image.
* **Alpha for Cross-Token Non-Maximum Suppression**: Controls how much effect the attention maps of CTNMS affects the image.
* **EMA Smoothing Factor**: Smooths the results based on the average of the results of the previous steps. 0 is disabled.

#### Known Issues:
Can error out with image dimensions which are not a multiple of 64

#### Results:
Prompt: "A photo of a lion and a grizzly bear and a tiger in the woods"  
SD XL

### Seek for Incantations
An incomplete implementation of a "prompt-upsampling" method from https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06345  
Generates an image following the prompt, then uses CLIP text/image similarity to add on to the prompt and generate a new image.  

#### Controls:
* **Append Generated Caption**: If true, will append an additional interrogated caption to the prompt. For Deepbooru Interrogate, recommend disabling.
* **Deepbooru Interrogate**: Uses Deepbooru to interrogate instead of CLIP.
* **Delimiter**: The word to separate the original prompt and the generated prompt. Recommend trying BREAK, AND, NOT, etc.
* **Word Replacement**: The word/token to replace dissimilar words with.
* **Gamma**: Replaces words below this level of similarity with the Word Replacement.

For example, if your prompt is "a blue dog", delimiter is "BREAK", and word replacement is "-", and the level of similarity of the word "blue" in the generated image is below gamma, then the new prompt will be "a blue dog BREAK a - dog"

A WIP implementation of the "prompt optimization" methods are available in branch ["s4a-dev2"](https://github.com/v0xie/sd-webui-incantations/tree/s4a-dev2)


#### Results:
SD XL  
* Original Prompt: cinematic 4K photo of a dog riding a bus and eating cake and wearing headphones  
* Modified Prompt: cinematic 4K photo of a dog riding a bus and eating cake and wearing headphones BREAK - - - - - dog - - bus - - - - - -
